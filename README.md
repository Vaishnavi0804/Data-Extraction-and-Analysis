# Data Extraction and Analysis
Data is extracted from Twitter and Reddit to understand the political slant (media bias) of US news websites to categorize them into left right and center.

## Brank 1: Twitter data extraction
- Code for data extraction is in the "Data Extraction code.ipynb" file. 
- "Sentiment Analysis code.ipynb" file has the code for understanding the sentiments (Postive, Neutral, Negative) of US news websites.
- In the sentiment analysis notebook, sentiment spectrum of mid-term elections is observed. 
- "Mid-term elections" have more of a neutral to a positive response (this can be observed from the bar plot). From the scatter plot it can be observed that most of the tweets are factual and neither factual nor opinion, but very few are opinions.

## Branh 2: Reddit data extraction
- Extracted content of subreddits - Politics, Government, Business, American Government, and Economics. Code for data extraction is in the file - "Reddit data extraction.Rmd"
